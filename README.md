# Clutter Zen

Clutter Zen is a cross-platform Flutter application that helps users declutter their digital lives. It combines onboarding flows, habit tracking, and cloud sync so people can organize files, tasks, and routines from one calm workspace.

## Features

- Guided onboarding with step-by-step illustrations to introduce the decluttering flow.
- Secure authentication and account creation experiences.
- Settings, navigation, and theming tuned for Android, iOS, desktop, and web.
- Firebase integration for data storage, secure rules, and cloud messaging hooks.
- Extendable backend (Firebase Functions) for heavier business logic.

## Tech Stack

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for mobile, desktop, and web clients.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) (Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions).
- Dart, Kotlin, Swift, and platform-native tooling generated by Flutter.

|- ENV_TEMPLATE.txt                          # Template for app environment variables
```

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.x or newer) with the appropriate platform tooling installed.
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter).
- Firebase CLI for deploying rules and functions.
- An `.env` file based on `ENV_TEMPLATE.txt` stored locally (never commit secrets).
- Google service configuration files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) placed in their platform folders.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
2. Copy `ENV_TEMPLATE.txt` to `.env` and fill in required keys.
3. Add platform configs:
   - `android/app/google-services.json`
   - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. (Optional) Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend/functions
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

```bash
flutter run            # Launch on connected device/emulator
flutter test           # Execute unit tests
flutter build apk      # Produce a release APK
```

## Firebase & Backend

- Update Firestore and Storage rules via:
  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
  ```
- Deploy Cloud Functions from `backend/functions` with:
  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only functions
  ```

## Contributing

1. Ensure anything listed in `.gitignore` (env files, local configs, generated artifacts) remains untracked.
2. Create feature branches from `main`, add tests where possible, and run `flutter analyze` before committing.
3. Open pull requests outlining motivation, screenshots (if UI), and testing notes.
